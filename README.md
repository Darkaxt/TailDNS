# Tailscale Android — local DNS override fork

An independent community fork of [tailscale/tailscale-android](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale-android), maintained by [Darkaxt](https://github.com/Darkaxt). This project is not an official Tailscale product or endorsed by Tailscale.

## Fork status

**Specification published; local DNS override not implemented.** The current changes are documentation only. There is no fork feature APK or Windows companion release.

The proposed feature lets a device choose its own DNS-over-HTTPS resolver, including a Control D endpoint/client, while preserving Tailscale's MagicDNS and applicable split-DNS routes. It does not require editing tailnet policy or changing other devices.

Specification v1.1 also requires native Android DNS/service lifecycle fixes intended to make **Thor Tailscale DNS Guard unnecessary**, with real Thor verification while the Guard is disabled. The Guard is evidence of failure scenarios, not a component to improve or embed. No native fix or Guard-obsolescence claim has been verified yet.

- [Authoritative specification](docs/local-dns-override/SPECIFICATION.md): required behavior, precedence, platform boundaries, and acceptance criteria.
- [Implementation evaluation](docs/local-dns-override/EVALUATION.md): source-backed corrections to the original recommendation and unresolved runtime evidence.
- [Staged implementation plan](docs/local-dns-override/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md): requirement mapping and verification gates; all implementation stages are **NOT STARTED**.

On Android, the intended setup keeps system Private DNS at **Default/Automatic** while Tailscale is active. Opt-in **automatic propagation** follows the saved hostname, not `isPrivateDnsActive()` or `getPrivateDnsServerName()`, without repeated imports or reconnects. An unprivileged probe confirmed saved-setting access on the Samsung Android 16 phone; change notifications, end-to-end propagation and Thor behavior remain unverified. Provider mappings require documented semantics. The pinned core supports recognized DoH providers, not arbitrary DoH or native DoT; generic manual DoH requires additional core work.

This Android repository owns the specification and Android integration. Implementation also requires a separately maintained shared Go-core change. Windows requires that core plus a new minimal configuration frontend: the official Windows GUI is not open source. Those components have not been created or implemented here.

## Overview

This repository contains the open source Tailscale Android client.

## Using

#### Tailscale Packages

The latest stable release APK can be obtained from the [Tailscale Packages Stable Track](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/#android).

Unstable releases can be obtained from the [Tailscale Packages Unstable Track](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/unstable/#android).

These APKs include all supported platforms and architectures.  For installing compact APKs, Android TV, or if you want automatic updates, visit the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tailscale.ipn).

#### Google Playstore

     alt="Get it on Google Play"
     height="80">](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tailscale.ipn)

Help us test new features and bug-fixes before they ship to all users! A [beta testing track](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.tailscale.ipn) is available on the Play Store. 

#### Amazon Appstore

The app can be downloaded from the [Amazon Appstore](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D38TRB3N) for Amazon Fire tablets and Fire TV devices.

#### F-Droid

The [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.tailscale.ipn/) project builds the source code in this repository and maintains independently-built APKs. Note that F-Droid builds are not released, updated, or verified by the Tailscale team.

## Preparing a build environment

There are several options for setting up a build environment. The Android Studio
path is the most useful path for longer term development.

In all cases you will need:

- Go runtime
- Android SDK
- Android SDK components (`make androidsdk` will install them)

### Android Studio

1. Install a Go runtime (https://go.dev/dl/).
2. Install Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio).
3. Start Android Studio, from the Welcome screen select "More Actions" and "SDK Manager".
4. In the SDK manager, select the "SDK Tools" tab and install the "Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)".
3. Run `make androidsdk` to install the necessary SDK components.

If you would prefer to avoid Android Studio, you can also install an Android
SDK. The makefile detects common paths, so `sudo apt install android-sdk` is
sufficient on Debian / Ubuntu systems. To use an Android SDK installed in a
non-standard location, set the `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable to the
path to the SDK.

If you installed Android Studio the tools may not be in your path. To get the
correct tool path, run `make androidpath` and export the provided path in your
shell.

#### Code Formatting

The ktmft plugin on the default setting should be used to autoformat all Java, Kotlin
and XML files in Android Studio.  Enable "Format on Save".

### Docker

If you wish to avoid installing software on your host system, a Docker based development strategy is available, you can build and start a shell with:

```sh
make docker-shell
```

Several other makefile recipes are available for setting up the proper build environment and running builds.

Note that the docker makefile recipes s will preserve the image and remove container on completion.
If changes are made to the build environment or toolchain, cached docker images may need to be rebuilt.
The docker build image name is parameterized in the makefile and changing it provides a simple means to do this.

### Nix

If you have Nix 2.4 or later installed, a Nix development environment can
be set up with:

```sh
alias nix='nix --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes"'
nix develop
```

The flake provides host tools such as Java, `make`, `curl`, and `git`, and
points the build at a repo-local Android SDK in `./android-sdk`. The SDK
directory is ignored by Git and is reused across builds.

On first use, install the Android SDK components:

```sh
make androidsdk
```

Then build normally:

```sh
make tailscale-debug
```

The debug APK is written to `./tailscale-debug.apk`.

For one-shot commands without entering an interactive shell:

```sh
nix develop --command make androidsdk
nix develop --command make tailscale-debug
```

For faster Kotlin-only iteration while avoiding the `gomobile bind` step:

```sh
nix develop --command bash -lc 'cd android && ./gradlew ktfmtCheck compileDebugKotlin'
```

## Building

```sh
make apk
make install
```

## Building a release

Use `make tag_release` to stamp the Play Store version code, update the version
name, and tag the current commit. The version code is derived from wall-clock
time (minutes since the Unix epoch) at release time and committed into
`android/build.gradle`, so it increases monotonically across all builds and
branches while staying fixed for any given commit.

We only guarantee to support the latest Go release and any Go beta or
release candidate builds (currently Go 1.14) in module mode. It might
work in earlier Go versions or in GOPATH mode, but we're making no
effort to keep those working.

## Developing on a Fire Stick TV

On the Fire Stick:

* Settings > My Fire TV > Developer Options > ADB Debugging > ON

Then some useful commands:
```
adb connect 10.2.200.213:5555
adb install -r tailscale-fdroid.apk
adb shell am start -n com.tailscale.ipn/com.tailscale.ipn.MainActivity
adb shell pm uninstall com.tailscale.ipn
```
